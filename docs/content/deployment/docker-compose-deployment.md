Deploy TuxSEO on your own server using Docker Compose.

## What you'll learn

- Set up TuxSEO with Docker Compose
- Configure environment variables
- Access your deployed application
- Troubleshoot common deployment issues

## Overview

Docker Compose provides a streamlined way to deploy TuxSEO on your server. This method handles all services (database, Redis, backend, and workers) with a single command.

This approach works best if you have a VPS or dedicated server where you can run Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A server with Docker and Docker Compose installed
- SSH access to your server
- Basic familiarity with command line
- API keys for AI services (Gemini, Perplexity, Jina Reader, Keywords Everywhere)

## Setup steps

### 1. Create deployment directory

SSH into your server and create a folder for TuxSEO:

```bash
mkdir tuxseo-deployment
cd tuxseo-deployment
```

### 2. Download and configure environment file

Download the example environment file from the TuxSEO repository:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rasulkireev/tuxseo/main/.env.example -O .env
```

Or if you prefer curl:

```bash
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rasulkireev/tuxseo/main/.env.example
```

Now edit the `.env` file to add your credentials:

```bash
nano .env
```

You need to configure several environment variables for TuxSEO to work properly. See the [Environment Variables](/docs/deployment/environment-variables/) guide for complete details on all available options.

At minimum, update these required values:

- AI API keys (GEMINI_API_KEY, PERPLEXITY_API_KEY, JINA_READER_API_KEY, KEYWORDS_EVERYWHERE_API_KEY)
- Database password (POSTGRES_PASSWORD)
- Redis password (REDIS_PASSWORD)
- Django secret key (SECRET_KEY)
- Allowed hosts (ALLOWED_HOSTS)
- Debug mode (DEBUG - set to False for production)

The `.env.example` file includes all available configuration options with explanations. Update any additional settings you need.

Save the file (in nano: Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

### 3. Download docker-compose file

Download the production docker-compose configuration from the TuxSEO repository:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rasulkireev/tuxseo/main/docker-compose-prod.yml -O docker-compose.yml
```

Or if you prefer curl:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rasulkireev/tuxseo/main/docker-compose-prod.yml
```
You can use the file as-is, or customize it if needed.

### 4. Start the application

Run this command to start all services:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml -p "tuxseo" up --detach --remove-orphans || true
```

Docker will:
- Download the necessary images
- Create the database and Redis containers
- Start the backend and worker services
- Run database migrations automatically

This takes 2-5 minutes on first deployment.

### 5. Verify deployment

Check that all services are running:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see four containers running: `db`, `redis`, `backend`, and `workers`.

Check the logs to ensure no errors:

```bash
docker-compose logs backend
```

## Expose your application

The backend runs on port 8000. You need to expose it to the internet.

### Option 1: Direct port access

If your server allows it, access TuxSEO at:

```
http://your-server-ip:8000
```

This works for testing but isn't recommended for production.

### Option 2: Nginx reverse proxy (recommended)

Install Nginx on your server:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

Create an Nginx configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/tuxseo
```

Add this configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Enable the site:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/tuxseo /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Now access TuxSEO at `http://yourdomain.com`.

### Option 3: Add SSL with Certbot

Secure your site with HTTPS:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
```

Follow the prompts. Certbot automatically configures SSL and sets up auto-renewal.
