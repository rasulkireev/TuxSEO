## UI/UX Considerations:
*   Intuitive dashboard for managing all marketing agents and their activities.
*   Clear progress indicators and notifications for ongoing tasks.
*   Easy-to-use editors for reviewing and refining AI-generated content.
*   Customizable settings for each agent to tailor automation to specific needs.
*   Seamless integration with popular marketing platforms and tools.
*   Mobile-responsive design for access on the go.

# Technical Architecture
## System Components:
*   **Core Platform:** Django-based backend handling user authentication, agent management, task queuing, and API integrations.
*   **AI Engine:** Integration with various LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral) for content generation, analysis, and strategy.
*   **Agent Modules:** Python modules for each specific marketing automation (e.g., `BlogAgent`, `CompetitorAgent`, `SocialMediaAgent`).
*   **Data Scrapers:** Tools for gathering data from websites, social media, and search engines (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Playwright, Jina Reader AI).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing user data, project configurations, generated content, and analytics.
*   **Task Queue:** Django-Q2 with Redis for managing asynchronous tasks like content generation, analysis, and posting.
*   **Frontend:** Django Templates with Stimulusjs controller to sprinle in some js interactivity. TailwindCSS for styling.
*   **API Layer:** Django-Ninja for RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend, and for external integrations.

## Data Models (High-Level):
*   `User`: Django's built it in Auth model.
*   `Profile`: Custom model extending User model (one-to-one)
*   `Project`: Each project has it's own instance. Each profile can have many projects
*   `TitleSuggestions`: For each project all blog post suggestions.
*   `GeneratedContent`: Content for each blog post title suggestion.
*   `Keywords`: Lists of keywords that we pulled from KeywordsEverywhere.
*   `ProjectKeywords`: Keywrods for each project.
*   `CompetitorProfile`: Data on identified competitors.
*   `SocialMention`: Log of monitored social media mentions.

## APIs and Integrations:
*   **LLM APIs:**
    * Google Gemini is used in most places. In the future we might use more, but not needed right now.
    * Perplexity is used for finding competitor, but hopefully we can find more uses.
    * Will add GPTResearcher for generating post (maybe other things)
*   **Blogging:**
    * Post to any API, by adding it manually in settings.
    * In the future hopefully can add nice, one click connections
*   **Social Media Platforms:**
    * No integrations yet.
    * As we develop the app, hopefully we can add more nice integrations.
    * To start with we can just use "share" link to major Social Media sites.
*   **Social Listening Tools:**
    * nothing yet
    * want to try using f5bot

## Infrastructure Requirements:
*   Hosted on my own server, via Caprover.
*   Current Github workflows deploy every time main branch is updated. All automatic.
*   Docker for containerization and consistent deployment.
*   No testing is configured
*   Logging and monitoring services (Sentry, Logfire).

# Risks and Mitigations
## Technical Challenges:
*   **Risk:** Complexity of integrating with numerous third-party APIs and ensuring reliability.
    *   **Mitigation:** Develop robust API wrapper libraries, implement thorough error handling and retry mechanisms. Prioritize official APIs over scraping where possible.
*   **Risk:** Maintaining quality and relevance of AI-generated content.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement multi-stage review processes (AI + human), allow user customization of AI prompts, provide clear guidelines and examples for AI, and continuously evaluate/fine-tune models.
*   **Risk:** Scalability of the platform as user base and data volume grow.
    *   **Mitigation:** Design for scalability from the start using cloud infrastructure, microservices architecture for key components, and efficient database management.

## MVP Scope & User Adoption:
*   **Risk:** Defining an MVP that is both valuable and achievable.
    *   **Mitigation:** Focus on a core set of high-impact automation features first (e.g., blog content, basic competitor analysis). Gather early user feedback to iterate quickly.
*   **Risk:** Users may be hesitant to trust full automation for sensitive marketing tasks.
    *   **Mitigation:** Emphasize human oversight and review capabilities. Start with recommendations and assistive features, gradually introducing more automation as user confidence builds. Provide clear transparency on how agents work.

## Resource Constraints:
*   **Risk:** Limited development resources impacting the speed of feature delivery.
    *   **Mitigation:** Prioritize features based on user value and impact. Adopt agile development methodologies. Leverage open-source tools and libraries where appropriate.
*   **Risk:** Cost of LLM API usage.
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize API calls, explore options for model fine-tuning or using more cost-effective models for certain tasks. Implement usage quotas and transparent pricing.
