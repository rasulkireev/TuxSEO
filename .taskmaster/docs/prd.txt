## APIs and Integrations:
*   **LLM APIs:**
    * Google Gemini is used in most places. In the future we might use more, but not needed right now.
    * Perplexity is used for finding competitor, but hopefully we can find more uses.
    * Will add GPTResearcher for generating post (maybe other things)
*   **Blogging:**
    * Post to any API, by adding it manually in settings.
    * In the future hopefully can add nice, one click connections
*   **Social Media Platforms:**
    * No integrations yet.
    * As we develop the app, hopefully we can add more nice integrations.
    * To start with we can just use "share" link to major Social Media sites.

    *   **Mitigation:** Develop robust API wrapper libraries, implement thorough error handling and retry mechanisms. Prioritize official APIs over scraping where possible.
*   **Risk:** Maintaining quality and relevance of AI-generated content.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement multi-stage review processes (AI + human), allow user customization of AI prompts, provide clear guidelines and examples for AI, and continuously evaluate/fine-tune models.
*   **Risk:** Scalability of the platform as user base and data volume grow.
    *   **Mitigation:** Design for scalability from the start using cloud infrastructure, microservices architecture for key components, and efficient database management.

## MVP Scope & User Adoption:
*   **Risk:** Defining an MVP that is both valuable and achievable.
    *   **Mitigation:** Focus on a core set of high-impact automation features first (e.g., blog content, basic competitor analysis). Gather early user feedback to iterate quickly.
*   **Risk:** Users may be hesitant to trust full automation for sensitive marketing tasks.
    *   **Mitigation:** Emphasize human oversight and review capabilities. Start with recommendations and assistive features, gradually introducing more automation as user confidence builds. Provide clear transparency on how agents work.

## Resource Constraints:
*   **Risk:** Limited development resources impacting the speed of feature delivery.
    *   **Mitigation:** Prioritize features based on user value and impact. Adopt agile development methodologies. Leverage open-source tools and libraries where appropriate.
*   **Risk:** Cost of LLM API usage.
